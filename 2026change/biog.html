              <a href="target4.html">Paquita Sabrafen</a>, was born in 1931 in Barcelona, Spain. She dedicated her life to her work and was a master in her profession.&nbsp;
              Having specialized in portraits, her brush strokes convey the spirit of her subject on to the canvas.&nbsp;
              A combination of control over her instruments and colours, with the powerfulness of a creative spirit, enabled her to convey many sentiments and ideals in her paintings.
              <br>&nbsp;<br>
              Sabrafen&rsquo;s paintings are in the collections of numerous prestigious National Art Museums worldwide:

              Sabrafen&rsquo;s works are found in private collections, public and private institutions, embassies and in religious institutions. Some on major altars, such as that of the Sanctuary of Capuchins in Alicante, &lsquo;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Orito,&rsquo; where approximately 200,000 people pilgrim each year. Others are in the church and convent of the Carmelites in the pueblo of Lietor (Albacete, Castilla la Mancha), wherein there are many works painted by the artist, and others which she has restored. Sabrafen&rsquo;s painting of &ldquo;Cruz Ortiz Real&rdquo; the Nun beatified by the Pope in March, 2004 hangs in the founding church of the Salessianas in Alicante, Spain. Life-size posters of this painting were carried on banners to the Vatican and hang in the churches and convents of the Salessianas all over the world.

              Paquita Sabrafen had a fascinating life, it is as though she experienced many lives in one. Tragically at four years of age her mother died. Then, as a result of the Spanish Civil War her father moved his children from Barcelona to Bordeaux, France. Due to the Second World War the family moved again away from the war to Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is here that she began her journey in art, taking lessons from the highly regarded artist Andrea Morch who was part of the impressionist movement in Argentina. She also studied under and was influenced by many other artists. Vincent Puig (former pupil of Spanish Artist Moises) taught her portraiture, drawing and painting in oils. She studied murals and landscapes with F. Guinart, learnt about painting human anatomy and marine scenery with Reverend Huget, and considered different animal figures with Viladrich as well as learning from and working with other masters. Many became her friends and considered her the young promise of their group.

              <br>
              Since 1950, her first solo exhibitions in Argentina were at the prestigious Galeria Muller (1950), the Alvear Palace (1956) and the Galeria Renon in Rosario (1959). 
              A couple of exhibitions included over 20 portraits and various landscapes and other.
              Sabrafen gained the unanimous applause of the critics.
              <br>
              <br>
              Paquita Sabrafen returned to Spain in 1963 to paint commissioned portraits, to exhibit and to reunite with family.

              <br>
              In Barcelona in December, 1963, Paquita Sabrafen had examinations approved and was qualified as a &ldquo;Maestro&rdquo; in the field of Artistic Painting by the Principal Guild of Master painters and Sculptures of the City of Barcelona.

              <br>
              Sabrafen has received official honours in a number of countries, both for her art and her other qualities. She maintained her vocation with unstinting energy until her death in January, 2009, thanks to her talent and her love of life which enabled her to show in her works the aspects of human endeavour.
              <br>
              <br>
              By the end of her life she had travelled extensively throughout the world but mainly had divided her time between Australia and Spain.
              <br>
              <br>
              Paquita Sabrafen dedicated a lifetime to her work and was a master in her profession. Her work and the fruits they bear are permanent.
